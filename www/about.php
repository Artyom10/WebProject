     <p>Peaky Blinders is a British period crime drama television series created by Steven Knight. Set in Birmingham, England, the series follows the exploits of the Shelby crime family in the direct aftermath of the First World War. The fictional family is loosely based on a real 19th century urban youth gang of the same name, who were active in the city from the 1890s to the early twentieth century.

Peaky Blinders features an ensemble cast, with Cillian Murphy, Helen McCrory, and Paul Anderson starring as Tommy Shelby, Elizabeth "Polly" Gray, and Arthur Shelby respectively, the gang's senior members.

In 2018,[1] after the show's Drama Series win at the BAFTA TV Awards, Knight confirmed his "ambition of making it a story of a family between two wars, and by ending it with the first air raid siren in Birmingham", which was 25 June 1940.[2] After the conclusion of the fourth series, he confirmed that it would take another three series (seven in total) to complete the story up to that point.[3] The fifth series premiered on BBC One on 25 August 2019 and finished on 22 September 2019.</p>
